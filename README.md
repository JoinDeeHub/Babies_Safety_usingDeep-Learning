Reqire GPU set up machine.

The dataset consists of 1500 images depicting numerous baby products - baby-proofing kits, toys, gadgets, and the like.

To build a Deep Learning model that will tag each image with the extracted product types and brand names of the products. 
In case there is no brand name mentioned on a product, the model should tag the image as Unnamed.

Challenge encourages you to apply your unsupervised Deep Learning skills to build models that can extract, identify, and tag brand names of various products.
This challenge will help you enhance your knowledge of image processing and optical character recognition (OCR), which is one of the advanced fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
We challenge you to build a model that will tag images with corresponding brand names of baby/kid products.
